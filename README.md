#  Crash Prediction and Risk Dashboard – Virginia Datathon 2025

This project was developed for the **Virginia Datathon 2025**, where our team was awarded **1st place** in the competition.

##  Problem Statement

Traffic accidents present significant risk to public safety and cost the state millions annually. How can we leverage open data and AI to:

- Identify the most dangerous roads and intersections in Virginia?
- Predict crash severity based on environmental and behavioral features?
- Help planners make smarter infrastructure and emergency decisions?

---

##  Our Solution

We built an end-to-end crash analysis system that combines:

-  **Data Engineering**: Cleaned and merged 1.2M+ crash records from Virginia’s Open Data Portal (2016–2022)
-  **Neural Network Model**: Predicts crash severity with ~70% accuracy
-  **Interactive Dashboard**: Highlights hotspots and risky areas for quick response and urban planning

---

##  Features

- **Crash Severity Prediction** using deep learning (Keras + TensorFlow)
- **Geo-Mapping of Dangerous Intersections** via Tableau & Google Maps
- **Dashboard Filters** by year, city, region, weather, lighting, and more
- **Real-Time Use Case Simulation** for emergency response and DOT planning

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Tableau for Visualization
- Virginia Open Data Portal

---

##  AI Component

We trained a custom neural network model using historical crash data with features like:

- Time of day
- Weather and road surface conditions
- Intersection type
- Lighting and visibility
- Driver behavior

➡ Output: Probabilistic prediction of **crash severity levels** (property damage, injury, fatal)
